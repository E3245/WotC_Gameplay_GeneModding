m_strWarnFirstTimeGeneModDialogText=Congrats, Commander! You are about to cross the line of unethical medical practices known as GENEtic MODding. Before going under the knife, there a few rules to follow:<ul><li><b>GENE MODS ARE PERMANENT!</b></li><li>You can cancel the project anytime, but the resources that went into this project will be wasted, and the soldier that was assigned to the slot will have a negative ability perk that is permanent until the next successful Gene Mod operation.</li><li>Some Gene mods require prerequisites.</li><li>Not all Gene Mods can be installed at once. Some types are incompatible with others.</li><li>Most Gene Mods cost Will.</li></ul>\n\nHave fun opening Pandora's Box!
