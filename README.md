## Contributing

Please follow the same formatting as you see in the code. It's not as good as the code style found in the [X2WotCCommunityHighlander](https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander#code-style) but it's readable enough to understand what's happening in the code. If you have any concerns or have questions about something that Iridar or I have written, either reach out to me or create an issue in the repo.

If you decide you want to contribute, please follow these conventions when submitting your code:

- Create a issue in Github for any new features, changes, bugfixes
- Create a pull request detailing what has changed/added and **reference that tracking issue** created above.
- Comment your code and changes. Be responsible for the comments you've written.
- Clear your committed code of any bugs
- Test your build and make sure it works properly

Failure to follow any of these points above will have their pull request rejected.
